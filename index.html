<p class="p1"><span class="s1">	I 
remembered reading that the smallest bird could travel 
thousands of miles across the Pacific unencumbered 
and alone, needing only one piece of baggage; one 
possession ... a twig. He could carry the twig in his 
beak and when he got tired he simply descended to the 
sea and floated on it until he was ready to move on 
again. He fished from the twig, ate from the twig, and 
slept on the twig. Who needed the Queen Mary ? He 
flapped his wings, clamped his life raft in his mouth and 
set out to see more of the world. </span></p>
