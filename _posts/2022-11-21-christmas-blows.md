The sheer amount of information that we have to learn just to get to the point that we know what we need to learn in mind bendingly daunting.

The books are great.  Weather.  Engines.  Watermakers.  Electrical systems.  Sailing.  

yada. yada. yada.  of course.

well, I've got news for you buddy....none of those books tell you about the Christmas winds.  

Why would they?  Christmas winds are specific to a part of the Caribbean, during a specific time of year.

For example, did you know that they are specific to the exact location where our boat needs to sail to get from Panama to ECUSA (East Cost USA)?

Also, did you know they kick in during mid December (aka "Christmas") and last through the winter?

Also, did you know that they are super gusty and harsh?

Also, did you know that Mid January is when we're delivering our boat?

Also, did you know that those trivial little steel cables called "standing rigging" that hold up the mast (that big pole in the middle with the big sail on it... and a bunch of expensive electronics like the radar)  should be replaced every 10 years.

Also, did you know that ours is 15 yrs old.

Looks like we'll be checking in withe the Captain quite a lot while they deliver.  I guess if we can't reach them...we start to worry?

Sigh, Christmas (winds) Blows.
