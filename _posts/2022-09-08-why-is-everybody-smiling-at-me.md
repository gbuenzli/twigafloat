Usually when I go on a walk with our dog Zulu, people pass by without a glance.  Maybe a couple half hearted "good morning"s.  But, today was different.  For some reason everybody I saw smiled at me.

Maybe they think I'm cute?  Sure, if you're into overweight middle age men with a receeding hairline.

Maybe my fly is down?  Nope, all systems go.

It's probably the dog.  She is adorable. Even with that long hanger of drool coming out of her mouth.

Then it dawned on me.  

I'M SMILING!

It turns out, when you smile, people have a tendancy to smile back.

Duh.

Well, no, not duh.  Not to me.  You see, I suffer from a severe case of RBF.  Despite the best efforts of doctors, psychiatrists, and comedians, my default resting face is somewhat of a frown.   When I think I'm smiling, it's actually more of a straight face.  A true smile is so rare that it actually aches my face muscles.

But not today, today my face is beaming and I can't stop it.

You see, today we went under contract on a <a href="/boat/lightening.html">beautiful Lagoon 450F</a> that is currently bobbing along in Fort Lauderdale.

After months of looking at every catamaran between 40 and 50 feet on the market, we finally found our dream boat!  It has everything we need (almost: we have to add A/C): solar, lithium, 4 cabins, flybridge, forward cockpit.  It's lovely!

It turns out that the cure to RBF is to have a mid life crisis,  spend your savings on a boat, move aboard with your family, and see the world.
