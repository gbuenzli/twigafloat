		We are a family of experience seekers, looking to float across the world on a (relatively) small boat. What we lack in experience, we make up for in desire and the passion to learn.  We are five.  We are from Colorado.  We are buying a 45 ft catamaran, selling most of our belongings, and setting off on a global adventure of unknown length.  As a family, we have been planning, saving, dreaming, and scheming for 16 years.  It's time to cast off those dock lines.
